If you have something to say to me, you can open an issue on this repo, even if it is not related to the repo.

I also use this repo as generic issue tracker for stuff that lacks a decent public issue tracker, e.g. companies / government.

Run local server:

    gem install bundle
    bundle install
    xdg-open http://localhost:4000
    ./run

Update gems:

    bundle update
    git add Gemfile.lock
