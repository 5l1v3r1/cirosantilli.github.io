I have started working at [Quartet FS](https://quartetfs.com) in Jan 2015 to help build their super fast OLAP database engine and surrounding products.

I am very lucky to have to have been accepted at this enterprise, as it was the first I seriously tried to join, and since they match [my interests](interests) by producing an useful, performance-critical product.

Furthermore, the working conditions are very good, with smart, friendly co-workers and an amazing localization at the heart of Paris.

I have decided to put my previous [Booktree project](https://github.com/booktree/booktree) on hold for [these reasons](https://github.com/booktree/booktree/blob/master/blog/2015-01-why-ciro-stopped-working-on-booktree.md).

I am investing full time on [**Booktree: Book Development with Version Control**][booktree]. [Presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTrZ6Zb39K8).

I will pursue this or other projects [**that interest me**](/interests) by:

-   joining a company. I will:

    - relocate anywhere (double Italian and Brazilian citizenship)
    - work for any wage that allows me to survive

-   creating my own company if none is up to it
