This explains the essense of what motivates me.

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and egineering.

I almost went into theorethical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it

- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics

- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff

- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!

- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free

- destroy the current educational system and replace it by elearning

- still have some fun myself!

This is why I am interested in:

- open source software and companies that rely on it

- web dev

- numerical methods

- science
