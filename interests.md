I am interested in tools that help people **produce** and **use** both **textual learning material** and **code** efficiently.

| Interest                           | Examples                                     |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Version control and web interfaces | Git, Subversion, GitHub                      |
| Author and content analytics       | Google PageRank, Stack Overflow gamification |
| Lightweight markup languages       | Markdown, LaTeX                              |
| Publishing and developer tools     | GitHub Pages, Vim, IDEs, CMSs, Wikipedia     |

I **don't care** about money or fame: they are just tools to help me to:

- improve the world
- provide for my loved ones

I can speak [a few languages](/self-evaluation#natural-languages) but I **strongly** prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in **English**, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

I like open source and companies that use it, but if you do something I believe in, I will use **whichever** license or tool you use.

I prefer **textual** learning sources (e.g. Wikipedia) to videos (e.g. Kahn Academy), because they are cheaper to make, modify, searchable and take less disk space and bandwidth. A sequence of well chosen images is better than any video.

I **don't** like MOOC tools that focus on:

- teaching at fixed time intervals
- evaluating students through tests

because:

- people must learn whatever they want whenever they want
- the only meaningful measures of success are citation metrics (e.g. Google Rank, Stack Overflow rep) and net worth

#Why I am interested in those things

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.

I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it
- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn
- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff
- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!
- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free
- destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people chose what they want to learn
- still have some fun myself!
