- elearning
- user and content analytics
- publishing and developer tools
- lightweight markup languages
- source control and interfaces like Git, Subversion, GitHub
- companies that offer amazing free products like Google or GitHub.
- companies that rely on open source software

I don't care about money or fame: they are just tools to help me to:

- improve the world
- provide for my loved ones

While I can speak [a few languages](/self-evaluation#natural-languages), I strongly prefer to produce content (code, documentation) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

#Why I am interested in those things

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.

I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it
- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn
- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff
- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!
- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free
- destroy the current educational system and replace it by elearning
- still have some fun myself!
