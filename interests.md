I am interested in:

-   tools that help people produce and use both textual learning material and code efficiently:

    | Interest                       | Examples                 |
    |--------------------------------|--------------------------|
    | Version control                | Git, GitHub              |
    | Lightweight markup languages   | Markdown, LaTeX          |
    | Publishing and developer tools | Text editors, IDEs, CMSs |

    Applications that interest me include: B2B training, ECM, college education and academic publishing.

-   low-level, performance critical applications: systems programming, network programming, HPC, scientific computing, compilers, databases...

I can speak [a few languages](/self-evaluation#natural-languages) but I strongly prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

I prefer textual learning sources (e.g. Wikipedia) over videos (e.g. Kahn Academy), because they are: cheaper to make, modify, searchable and take less disk space and bandwidth. A sequence of well chosen images is better than any video.

I like open source, but I will use whichever license achieves the goals better.

I don't care about money or fame: they are just tools to help me to:

- improve the world
- provide for my loved ones

## Why I am interested in those things

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.

I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it
- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn
- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff
- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!
- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free
- destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people chose what they want to learn
- still have some fun myself!
