The key content previously on this page was moved to the following sections:

- [/#ideology](/#ideology)
- [/#projects-todo](/#projects-todo)

Other general interests areas:

-   low-level, performance critical technologies that increase humanity's computational capacity: operating systems, GPUs, integrated circuit design, compilers, network programming,  databases, file systems, cryptography, virtualization, optimization, numerical analysis, ... The final goal of all of those for me is [silicon AGI](#sci-fi).

Things I'll try to get my kids into because I don't have enough time in this life:

-   <https://github.com/cirosantilli/awesome-whole-cell-simulation>. It's weird, cells feel a lot like embedded systems: small, complex and profound. To reach both [biological AGI](#sci-fi) and [immortality](#sci-fi). Especially excited about: cell biology and simulations, cell metabolism, microscopy, analytical chemistry (mass spectroscopy), DNA sequencing, DNA synthesis, synthetic biology, protein and small molecule simulation.

    It saddens me that I'll die and humanity won't have understood the brain, maybe not even a measly E. Coli...

I really like open source. It gives more opportunities to the poor countries, and reduces lock-in to my current employer. Shame it is not always economically feasible...

I can speak [a few languages](/skills#natural-languages) but I strongly prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

I'm not a big fan of working remotely, because you don't feel people's love as strongly, and usefulness is built on love. But please, give me a small silent office so I can concentrate instead of a silly open space, and create an internal social network so I can see what others are doing. Remote working can only be attempted if the majority of the team also does it, otherwise you will get excluded. Maybe after VR...

For large resources, I prefer textual information (e.g. wikis, issue trackers) over non-textual (e.g. videos, meetings), because it is cheaper to make, modify, searchable, often more precise, and takes less disk space and bandwidth. A sequence of well chosen images is better than any video. Videos must be short and juicy, just to share the love.

I am also interested in academia. I like to teach (people who want to learn) and produce optimal learning material.

I can't stand crappy tools and documentation. If you have crappy tools, I will end up fixing those tools instead of doing what you tell me to do. Which might lead to me quitting because I can't stand the tools, or you firing me because I'm not doing the job you think I should be doing.

If our interests coincide, ping me even if you don't have an specific proposal immediately. I want to know that you exist :-)
