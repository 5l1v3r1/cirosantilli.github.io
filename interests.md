| Interest | Examples |
|-
| Elearning, [open education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_education), tools that help people learn | Google, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia |
| Version control and web interfaces | Git, Subversion, GitHub |
| User and content analytics / metrics | Google rank, Stack Overflow gamification |
| Lightweight markup languages | Markdown, LaTeX |
| Publishing tools | CMSs, GitHub Pages, Wikipedia |
| Companies that offer **amazing** free(mium) products | Google, GitHub, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia |

I **don't** care about money or fame: they are just tools to help me to:

- improve the world
- provide for my loved ones

I can speak [a few languages](/self-evaluation#natural-languages) but I **strongly** prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

I like open source and companies that use it, but if you do something I believe in, I don't care which license or tools you use.

#Why I am interested in those things

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.

I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it
- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn
- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff
- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!
- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free
- destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people chose what they want to learn
- still have some fun myself!
