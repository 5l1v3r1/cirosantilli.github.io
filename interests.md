title: Professional Interests

Crazy projects yet without prototypes that I really want to do and which could change the world:

-   <https://github.com/cirosantilli/write-free-science-books-to-get-famous-website>
-   <https://github.com/cirosantilli/gpu-robot-vision-simulation-full-ai>

General interests areas:

-   low-level, performance critical technologies: operating systems, GPUs, compilers, network programming, RISC-V, databases, file systems, cryptography, virtualization, optimization, numerical analysis, ...
-   tools that help people produce and use both textual learning material and code efficiently: Git, GitHub, Markdown, LaTeX, text editors, IDEs, CMSs, Stack Overflow, reputation systems / user rankings gamification.

I like open source, but I will use whichever license better serves society.

I can speak [a few languages](/skills#natural-languages) but I strongly prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

I prefer textual information (e.g. wikis, issue trackers) over non-textual (e.g. videos, meetings), because it is cheaper to make, modify, searchable, often more precise, and takes less disk space and bandwidth. A sequence of well chosen images is better than any video.

I am also interested in academia. I like to teach (people who want to learn) and produce optimal learning material.

I like working remotely.

If our interests coincide, ping me even if you don't have an specific proposal immediately. I want to know that you exist :-)

## Why I am interested in those things

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.

I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it
- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn
- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff
- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!
- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free
- destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people choose what they want to learn
- still have some fun myself!

## Sci-fi

[Unconditional basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) is my ultimate [non-transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) dream: to reach a state of technological advancement and distribution of resources so high that everyone gets money for doing nothing, enough for:

- basic survival needs: food, housing, clothes, hygiene, etc.
- two children to keep the world going. Or immortality tech, but I think that is harder :-)
- high speed computer and Internet

Once a person has that, he can learn, teach and create whatever he wants. Or play video games all day long if he so wishes.

I don't think I will live to see this, so I content myself with helping it happen faster by increasing the efficiency of the world as I can.

[Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots).

Technologies which would help a lot towards unconditional basic income and might be required but which I don't think I will live to see:

-   [Artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)

-   affordable [humanoid robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot) with human-like energy efficiency and [power-to-weight ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio)

-   [Brain in a vat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat). Might imply trans-humanism.

    Might require humanoid robots or a very interesting [simulated reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality) to become popular. Or maybe just video-games + non-physical jobs would suffice for many people?

AGI is the most likely of the above.

AGI + humanoid robots likely implies [AI takeover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover).

But AGI alone would be very dangerous, in case it can get control of our nuclear arsenals through software zero days or [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29). Although some [claim that is unlikely](https://www.quora.com/Could-a-group-of-hackers-break-into-military-networks-and-launch-or-detonate-nuclear-missiles).
