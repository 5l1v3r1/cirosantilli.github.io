I am interested in:

-   low-level, performance critical technologies: operating systems, compilers, databases, filesystems, network programming, HPC, scientific computing,...

-   tools that help people produce and use both textual learning material and code efficiently.

    Tools: Git, GitHub, Markdown, LaTeX, text editors, IDEs, CMSs.

    Applications: B2B training, ECM, college education and academic publishing.

I can speak [a few languages](/skills#natural-languages) but I strongly prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don't mind speaking other languages at the office however.

I prefer textual information (e.g. wikis, issue trackers) over non-textual (e.g. videos, meetings), because it is cheaper to make, modify, searchable, often more precise, and takes less disk space and bandwidth. A sequence of well chosen images is better than any video.

I like open source, but I will use whichever license better serves society.

## Why I am interested in those things

I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.

I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:

- I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it
- it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn
- the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff
- I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!

So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:

- make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!
- better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free
- destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people chose what they want to learn
- still have some fun myself!
