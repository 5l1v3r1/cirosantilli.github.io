I am investing full time on what I believe will be the future of education by:

- hacking the best open source GitHub clone, [Gitlab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq), to adapt it to education.

    My fork with a detailed idea explanation: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/gitlab-elearn>

- hacking open source tools that Github uses for [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/) and its supported markup engines like [Kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown).

I intend to pursue those projects either by:

- joining a company which does similar things
- creating my own company if none is up to it
