This explains what I'm current doing with my time.

I am currently taking a gap year.

I am investing full time on what I believe will be the future of education by:

- hacking the best open source GitHub clone, [Gitlab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq), to adapt it to education.

    My fork with a detailed idea explanation: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/gitlab-elearn>

- hacking open source tools that Github uses for [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/) and its supported markup engines like [Kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown).
