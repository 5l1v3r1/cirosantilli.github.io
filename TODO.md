# TODO

-   Make tables and code blocks show scrollbar when screen is small.

    Currently:

    - some tables overflow (e.g. skills page)
    - code blocks wrap

    Even better on mobile: allow user to drag slide anywhere on over the code block.

-   Make headings smaller on mobile.

-   Move share links into article area just below the title.
    Otherwise it is not clear what is being shared.
