I participated in a double degree program, so I have engineering degrees in both:

- [Ecole Polytechnique (Lozere, France)](http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/Ecole-Polytechnique.html).

    [3rd highest ranked engineering school in France according to the Shanghai rating 2013](http://www.shanghairanking.com/FieldENG2013.html).

    Master 2 degree in Applied Mathematics (2014).

- [University of Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo, Brazil)](http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/University-of-Sao-Paulo.html).

    [2nd highest ranked engineering school in Brazil according to the Shanghai rating 2013](http://www.shanghairanking.com/FieldENG2013.html).

    Automation and Control Engineer (2013).

    Completed with honors: "Best Student in Automation and Control of the year 2013".

Despite studying in great institutions with great teachers, I feel that:

- most of [what I know](/self-evaluation) came from books, the Internet and my parents.
- [what I really love to do](/interests) is slightly different, but related, to my official degrees.
- [actual contributions](/contrib) matter much more than pieces of paper.
