I participated in a **double degree program**, so I have engineering degrees in both:

-   **2010 - 2014**: [**École Polytechnique (Palaiseau, France)**](http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/Ecole-Polytechnique.html)

    Master 2 degree in Applied Mathematics.

    Amongst French engineering schools: [**best** on Times Ranking 2013](https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/subject-ranking/subject/engineering-and-IT), [3rd on Shanghai ranking 2013](http://www.shanghairanking.com/FieldENG2013.html).

-   **2007 - 2010**: [**University of São Paulo (Brazil)**](http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/University-of-Sao-Paulo.html)

    Automation and Control Engineer.

    In South America: [**best** on Times Ranking 2013 all subjects](https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking/region/south-america), [2nd on Shanghai ranking 2013 engineering](http://www.shanghairanking.com/FieldENG2013.html)

    Honors: **"Best Student in Automation and Control of the year 2013"**.

Despite studying in great institutions with great teachers, I feel that:

- most of [what I know](/skills) came from books, man pages, forums and my parents.
- [what I really love to do](/interests) is slightly different, but related, to my official degrees.
- [actual contributions](/projects) matter much more than pieces of paper.
