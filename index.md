# Current Activity

I am investing full time on what I believe will be the future of education by:

- hacking the best open source GitHub clone, [Gitlab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq) ([GitHub top 30 by stars](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=stars%3A%3E10000&ref=searchresults&type=Repositories), [6 people working full time with service revenue](https://www.gitlab.com/about/) as of 2014-02), to adapt it to textbook development and class management.

    My fork with a detailed idea explanation: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/gitlab-elearn>

I am also considering:

- hacking open source tools that GitHub uses for [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/) and its supported markup engines like [Kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown).

I intend to pursue those projects either by:

- joining a company which does [something that interests me](/interests)
- creating my own company if none is up to it

If you do something that interests me, I will relocate anywhere (double Brazillian and Italian citizenship) and work for any wage that allows me to survive. I am currently Paris based.
