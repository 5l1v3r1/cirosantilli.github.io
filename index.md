## Writings

Writings you may find interesting:

- [Markdown Style Guide](markdown-style-guide)
- [x86 Paging Tutorial](x86-paging)

or if I may interest you in some Stack Overflow answers:

- [What's the difference between dependencies, devDependencies and peerDependencies in npm package.json file?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22004559/895245)
- [What is the difference between old style and new style classes in Python?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19950198/895245)

I also have several comprehensive cheatsheets listed at [my self evaluation section](self-evaluation), but those won't make for good casual reading unless you are a robot.

## Current occupation

I am investing full time on [**Booktree: Book Development with Version Control**][booktree]. [Presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTrZ6Zb39K8).

I will pursue this or other projects [**that interest me**](/interests) by:

-   joining a company. I will:

    - relocate anywhere (double Italian and Brazilian citizenship)
    - work for any wage that allows me to survive

-   creating my own company if none is up to it

I am currently Paris based.
