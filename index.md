# Current Activity

I am investing full time on the future of education: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/gitlab-elearn>

Summary:

- GitHub clone
- specialized in **book development**:
    - compiles books for you
    - lets you give or sell the output
- based on **[GitLab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq)**, the best open source GitHub clone ([GitHub top 30 by stars](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=stars%3A%3E10000&ref=searchresults&type=Repositories), [6 people working full time with service revenue](https://www.gitlab.com/about/) as of 2014-02).

I intend to pursue this or a related project either by:

- joining a company which does [something that interests me](/interests)

    I will:

    - relocate anywhere (double Brazilian and Italian citizenship)
    - work for any wage that allows me to survive

- creating my own company if none is up to it

I am currently Paris based.
