## Current occupation

Looking for an [interesting job](interests), studying for interviews and for pleasure, and sending out CVs.

I was fired from my job at [Quartet FS](http://quartetfs.com) after a 3 month trial period.

I learned a lot about programing and group work, people treated me well, and I don't hold grudges against anyone. Reasons they gave me:

-   "I worked too carefully but not fast enough."

    I accept this point, but it was not for lack of interest or dedication, but rather because:

    -   this is the first time I worked seriously with Java, Eclipse, OLAP and finance, so I tried to learn the basics to avoid making mistakes and do learn how to work efficiently. Learning takes time.

        For example, I once taught a 3-year old programmer of the enterprise (who is *very* competent, and whom I respect very much), that [local classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/localclasses.html) exist in Java. I RTFM :-).

    -   I have made small suggestions of new ideas to the team, that took up 2% of my working time, but which my boss though were the only think I was doing instead of my obligations.

        This perception was amplified by [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality) effect: those were simple suggestions, so everyone had an opinion, and in the end they all had to go through the boss. And of course, it was I who had to go talk to him, even though I though them trivial and didn't merit his attention.

        I humbly advise by boss to watch for this effect, as it leads to people being afraid and proposing fewer new ideas.

    I agree that there is a fine balance between quantity and quality, and that I have a tendency to quality, but I believe I'm not too extreme either.

-   "I wasn't able to discuss new ideas with the team."

    I contest this point.

    All the people I've really worked with (i.e.: not the bosses) were really surprised that I was fired, because we liked working with each other.

    Because I was still learning the basics, there were times I could not make useful comments on more "advanced" discussions, nor ask the right questions. In programming, when you know the right thing to ask, you can usually answer it yourself.

    But I did like to hear other's opinions about the job, what they were doing, opportunities, etc. and give my opinion when I have something worthy to say. But when I don't, I'd rather not waste other people's time.

    Things which amplified this perceptions for my bosses:

    - during my break time, I need silence. I must get away from everyone, and not talk or listen to anything. So I went to the garden. I think my bosses interpreted that as anti-social behaviour, even though smokers did the same. I timed my breaks methodically and rested no more than others.

    - once, boss number 2 was discussing something on the desk in front of me for half an hour. This was one of the few moments where noise bothered me in this work, so I politely asked him to either speak less loud, find a room to talk, or that I could find a room to work while they were discussing. But boss number 2 was relatively young, and I didn't know that he was the boss number 2 at the time! Ouch.

I hold no grudges against my bosses. They are very competent, and I see that business decisions are difficult to make. I keep learning to do better next time.
