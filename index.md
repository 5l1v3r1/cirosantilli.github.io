## Current occupation

I have started working at [Quartet FS](https://quartetfs.com) in Jan 2015 to help build their super fast OLAP database engine.

I am very lucky to have to have been accepted at this enterprise, as it was the first I seriously tried to join, and since they match [my interests](interests) by producing an useful, performance critical product.

Furthermore, the working conditions are very good, with smart, friendly co-workers and an amazing localization at the heart of Paris.
