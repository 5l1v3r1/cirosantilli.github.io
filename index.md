# Occupation

I am investing full time on [**Booktree: Book Development with Version Control**](https://github.com/booktree/booktree). [Presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTrZ6Zb39K8).

I will pursue this or other projects [**that interest me**](/interests) by:

- joining a company. I will:
    - relocate anywhere (double Italian and Brazilian citizenship)
    - work for any wage that allows me to survive
- creating my own company if none is up to it

I am currently Paris based.
