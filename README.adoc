== Getting started with Ciro

=== Quick facts

* Nationalities: Italian and Brazilian
* Grew up in: Brazil
* Relationship status: married
* Chinese name: 三西猴, means "three western monkeys". Phonetic approximation to SANtilli CIRO. Semi-unintentionally reminds Chinese people of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong[Sun Wukong].
* Laptop: high end ThinkPad
* Distro: latest Ubuntu release
* Vim or Emacs: Vim. But for The Love, will someone please make an open source C++ IDE that actually just works?
* Tabs or spaces: spaces
* Mailing list or Git(Hub|Lab): Git(Hub|Lab), link:https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23197/reply-to-mailman-archived-message/115088#115088[with passion]
* System or unit tests: system
* Default programming languages: Python and C++. <<programming-language-choice,I'll learn Rust and Haskell once I'm rich>>
* Favorite musical instruments to listen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin[Chinese Guqin] and electric Jazz-fusion guitar

=== Projects done

These are the most important projects that I feel I've done so far.

In retrospect, I sometimes I wish I had focused on even greater impact things, some of them in the <<projects-todo>> section.

But maybe "Everything you did brought you where you are now." type of stuff: maybe it is during the "low impact activities" that we get the inspiration and experience required for the "high impact ones".

==== Linux kernel module cheat

https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat

This is the most important technical tutorial project that I've done in my life so far as of 2019.

The scope is insane and unprecedented, and goes beyond Linux-kernel-land alone.

It ate up every system programming content I had previously written, including:

* C, C++, POSIX
* x86 and arm userland assembly
* arm baremetal assembly. x86 baremetal is at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples and would in theory be migrated, but I'm lazy
* QEMU and gem5 emulation

so that this repo would better be called "system-programming-cheat". But "Linux kernel module cheat" sounds more hardcore ;-)

Other major things that could be added there as well in the future are:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/algorithm-cheat
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture[computer architecture] tutorials with gem5

==== Stack Overflow contributions

{cirosantilli-stack-overflow}

{cirosantilli-stack-overflow}[image:https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/895245.png?theme=dark[Stack overflow flare]]

My contributions have, unsurprisingly, centered around the subjects I have worked with: systems programming and web development, and necessary tooling to get those done, such a Git, Python, Bash and Ubuntu.

My self-selected best answers are listed at: <<articles>>

In Stack Overflow I like to:

* answer important questions found through Google which I need to solve an actual problem I have right now, and for which none of the existing answers satisfied me, and close duplicates.
* monitor less known tags which very few people know a lot about, but in which I specialize

I don't like to refresh the homepage looking for easy rep on widely known subjects.

For this reason, https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/17/necromancer[Necromancer] is my favorite badge (get 5 upvotes on a question older than 60 days), and As of July 2019, https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/300735/users-with-most-necromancer-badges-at-a-given-date?Date=2019-07-15[I became the #1 user with the most of this badge]. Announcement link:https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1146157392343785474[on Twitter].

The number two is link:https://stackoverflow.com/users/6309[VonC], who has about 16 times more answers than me in total! From this query: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1072396?&Date=2019-07-01&UserId=895245 it can be seen that as of July 2019, 1216 out of my 1329 answers were answered 60 days after the questions and constitute potential necromancers! Compare that to VonC's 1643 potential necromancers out of 21767 answers!

Stack Overflow reputation is of course, in itself, meaningless. People who contribute to popular subjects like web development will always have infinitely more reputation that the low level subjects.

For example, my most upvoted answer as of July 2019 is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies/22004559#22004559 was written when I spent my first week playing with NodeJS (I was having a look at https://www.sharelatex.com/[ShareLaTeX], later merged into https://www.overleaf.com/[Overleaf], for <<write-free-books-to-get-famous-website,education>>), which I didn't touch again for several years, and still haven't "mastered" as of 2019!

What happens on the specialized topics though is that you end up getting to know all the 5 users who contribute 95% of the content pretty soon as you study those subjects.

My deep understanding of Stack Overflow mechanisms and its shortcomings also helped shape my ideas for: <<write-free-books-to-get-famous-website>>.

After answering so many questions, I ended up converging to a more or less consistent style, which I formalized at: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18614/style-guide-for-questions-and-answers/326746#326746

==== Campaign for freedom of speech in China

{cirosantilli-china-dictatorship}

link:xi-jinping-chrysanthemum-230-liusi.jpeg[image:xi-jinping-chrysanthemum-230-liusi.jpeg[]]

Like most people in the West, I have always been for political freedom of speech, and therefore against the Chinese government's policies.

However, the seriousness of the matter only fully dawned on me in 2015 when, my mother-in-law, a then a 63-year-old lady, was put into jail for 15 days for doing https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/714d8104549ea19714787f148ff93c7403fd120c#falun-gong[Falun Gong].

In response, I decided to use my <<stack-overflow-contributions,considerable Stack Overflow presence>> to sabotage the website in China with keywords censored keywords on my username, for example: http://web.archive.org/web/20150602004401/https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245/ciro-santilli-%e5%85%ad%e5%9b%9b%e4%ba%8b%e4%bb%b6-%e6%b3%95%e8%bd%ae%e5%8a%9f-%e7%ba%b3%e7%b1%b3%e6%af%94%e4%ba%9a%e8%83%a1%e6%b5%b7%e5%b3%b0

The rationale of this is to force the Chinese Government to either:

* leave things as they are, and let censored keywords appear on Stack Overflow (most likely scenario)
* block Stack Overflow, and lose billions of dollars with worse IT technology
* disable the Great Firewall

Full rationale is described at: {cirosantilli-china-dictatorship}/tree/714d8104549ea19714787f148ff93c7403fd120c#why-keyword-attack

In the beginning, this link:https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/236407528ab6424504e442e070d632496c110087#backlinks-to-this-repository[generated some commotion], but activity reduced as novelty wore off, and as I collected the reply to all possible comments at: {cirosantilli-china-dictatorship}

==== Minor projects

These are some smaller projects that I carried out. They are all either for fun, or misguided use of my time done by an younger self.

* Naughty stuff. I like being naughty.

=== Projects TODO

These are projects which I'm seriously considering doing, and which I believe could have a considerable impact in the world, given a few months of work.

They are sorted in order of "most likely to get done first".

==== Write free books to get famous website

https://github.com/cirosantilli/write-free-science-books-to-get-famous-website

In this project, I want to explore if it is possible to create a sustainable website that will make people write university-level natural science books for free.

The initial incentive for those people is to make them famous and allow them to get more fulfilling jobs more easily, although I also want to add money transfer mechanisms to it later on.

The key intended technical innovation of the website is a PageRank-like algorithm that answers the key questions:

* who knows the most about subject X
* what is the best content for subject X

where any user can create any new subject X.

I envision a Wikipedia-like page, where you can fork a version of any subject or header to improve it, suggest changes via a "GitHub-pull-request-like" mechanism, and create bug reports under any given header.

Then, while reading an article about a subject, say, "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus", you would be able to click a button, and easily view the other best articles about that subject.

Many subjects have changed very little in the last hundred years, and so I find it mind-blowing that people have to pay for books that teach them!

More than that however, if such project succeeds, it could fundamentally change the way university is organized, enormously improving its efficiency.

It could destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people choose what they want to learn.

===== Write free books to get famous website motivation

Since I was young, I have been bewildered by the natural sciences and mathematics.

As a result, I have always suffered a lot at school: my grades were good, but I wasn't really learning those beautiful things that I wanted to learn!

School, instead of helping me, was just wasting my time with superficial knowledge.

First, before university, school organization had only one goal: put you into the best universities, to make a poster out of you and get publicity, so that more parents will be willing to pay them money to put their kids into good university.

Then, after entering university, although things got way better, teachers were still to a large extent researchers who didn't want to, know how to and above all have enough time and institutional freedom to teach things properly and make you see their beauty.

This is especially true because I was in Brazil, a third world country, where the opportunities are comparatively extremely limited to the first world.

And all of this is considering that was I was very luck and was already in some of the best educational institutions locally available already, and had comparatively awesome teachers. I wouldn't be here today if I hadn't had such advantages in the first place.

But no matter how awesome one teacher is, no single person can overcome a system so large and broken, without technological innovation that is.

The key problem all along the way is the Society's / Government's belief that everyone has to learn the same things, and that grades in exams mean anything.

I believe however, that exams are useless, and that there are only two meaningful metrics:

* reputation points for doing useful work for society
* how much money you make

Around 2012 however, I finally saw the light.

Firstly, I was introduced to LaTeX, and my mind was blown. Ha, so I can write my own books, and so can anyone, for free? Why isn't everyone doing that!

Then I found two websites that changed my life forever, and made be believe that there was an alternative: <<stack-overflow-contributions,Stack Overflow>> and {cirosantilli-github}[GitHub].

The brutal openness of it all. The raw high quality content. Ugliness and uselessness too no doubt. But definitely spark in a sea of darkness.

University was not needed anymore. I could learn whatever I wanted. A vision was born.

To make things worse, for a long time I was tired of seeing poor people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it.

So, by the time I left University, instead of pursuing a PhD in theoretical Mathematics or Physics just for the beauty of it as I had once considered, I had new plans.

We needed a new educational system. One that would allow people to fulfill their potential and desires, and truly <<ultimate-life-goal,improve society as a result>>, both in rich and poor countries.

And I found out that programming and applied mathematics could also be fun, so I might as well have some fun while doing this! ;-)

So I started {cirosantilli-booktree}[Booktree] in 2014, worked on it for an year, noticed the idea was dumb, and then started building this new idea and the courage to do it.

==== Design a large cohesive game world for robotic-like artificial intelligence development

Prototype: https://github.com/cirosantilli/Urho3D-cheat YouTube demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_fl4xoGTKU

Less good discrete prototype: https://github.com/cirosantilli/rl-game-2d-grid YouTube demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5k2u25eI8

Prior art research: https://github.com/cirosantilli/awesome-reinforcement-learning-games

link:ai-game-2d-continuous-basketball.png[image:ai-game-2d-continuous-basketball.png[]]

The goal of this project is to reach <<ultimate-life-goal,artificial general intelligence>>.

A few initiatives have created reasonable sets of robotics-like games for the purposes of AI development, most notably: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI[OpenAI] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind[Google DeepMind].

However, all projects I've seen so far have only created sets of unrelated games, or worse: focused on closed games designed for humans!

What I really feel is needed is to create a single cohesive game world, designed specifically for this purpose, and with a very large number of game mechanics.

Notably, by "game mechanic" I mean "a magic aspect of the game world, which cannot be explained by object's location and inertia alone". For example:

* when you press a button here, a door opens somewhere far away
* when you touch certain types of objects, a chemical reaction may happen, but not other types of objects

Much in the spirit of link:http://www.gvgai.net/[], I we have to do the following loop:

* create an initial game
* find an AI that beats it well
* study the AI, and add a new mechanic that breaks the AI, but does not break a human!

The question then becomes: do we have enough computational power to simulation a game worlds that is analogous enough to the real world, so that our AI algorithms will also apply to the real world?

To reduce computation requirements, I have decided to focus on a 2D world at first. I am confident that such world with the right mechanics can break any AI, while still being faster to simulate than a 3D world.

My prototype used the Urho3D open source game engine, and that is a reasonable project, but I feel a raw SDL + Box2D + OpenGL solution from scratch would be faster to develop for my use case, since Urho3D has a lot of human-gaming features that I don't need. Also me and the 2019 maintainer link:https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/236407528ab6424504e442e070d632496c110087/communities-that-censor-politics.md[don't share certain political views :-)], so I was blocked from the GitHub project and forum.

==== Create a website front-end for a mathematical formal proof system

When I first learnt the old link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory] and the idea of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof[Formal proofs], my mind was completely blown.

Finally, there it was: a proper and precise definition of mathematics, including a definition of integers, reals and limits!

Theorems are strings, proofs are string manipulations, and axioms are the initial strings that you can use.

Once proved, press a button on your computer, and the proof is automatically verified. No messy complicated "group of savants" reading it for 4 years and looking for flaws!

I am aware of a few formal proof systems with several theorems in their Git tracked standard library. I don't know which one is best, nor have I used any of them, but the hottest ones seem to be:

* https://github.com/coq/coq[]
* https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL[]
* https://github.com/seL4/isabelle[]. I've been told however that this is "uncompilable" from source without blobs, to be verified.

And here are some more interesting links:

* https://github.com/awesomo4000/awesome-provable an awesome list of formal stuff
* https://devel.isa-afp.org/ Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs. A curated list of Isabelle proofs, with minimal web UI. I want this, but without the manual curation, and with a better web UI.
* http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/ list of how many of the http://web.archive.org/web/20080105074243/http://personal.stevens.edu/~nkahl/Top100Theorems.html["Top 100 theorems"] had been proved in several formal systems.

However, it still blows my mind, that there isn't one awesome and dominating website, that hosts all those proofs, possibly an on the browser editor, and which all mathematicians in the world use as the one golden reference of mathematics to rule them all! 

Just imagine the impact.

Standard library maintainers don't have to deal with the impossible question of what is "beautiful" or "useful" enough mathematics to deserve merged: users just push content to the online database, and star what they like!

Interested in a conjecture? No problem: just subscribe to its formal statement + all known equivalents, and get an email on your inbox when it gets proved!

Are you a garage mathematician and have managed to prove a hard theorem, but no will will read your proof? Fuck that, just publish it on the system and let it get auto verified. Overnight fame awaits.

Notation incompatibility hell? A thing of the past, just automatically convert to your preferred representation.

Such a system would be the perfect companion to: <<write-free-books-to-get-famous-website>>. Just like computer code offers the backbone of <<linux-kernel-module-cheat>> Linux kernel tutorials, a formal proof system website would be the backbone of mathematics tutorials!

Furthermore, it would not be too hard to achieve this system!

All we would need would be something analogous to a package registry like https://pypi.org/[Python's PyPI] or https://www.npmjs.com/[NodeJS' registry].

Then, each person can publish packages containing proofs.

Packages can rely on other packages that contain pre-requisites definition or theorem.

Packages are just regular git repos, with some metadata. One notable metadata would be a human readable description of the theorems the package provides.

The package registry would then in addition to most package registries have a CI server in it, that checks the correctness of all proofs, generates a web-page showing each theorem.

All proofs can be conditional: the package registry simply shows clearly what axiom set a theorem is based on.

==== Molecular biology

https://github.com/cirosantilli/awesome-whole-cell-simulation

I know "nothing" about this domain, but I see it clearly that silicon industry is ending, and that molecular biology technology is the most promising and growing field today.

Such advances could one day lead to both <<ultimate-life-goal,biological super-AGI and immortality>>.

First, during the 2000's, the cost of sequencing fell to about 1000 USD per genome in the end of the 2010's. The medical consequences of this revolution are still trickling down the application ladder today, inevitably, but somewhat slowly due to tight control of medical records.

link:human-genome-sequencing-cost-evolution.png[image:human-genome-sequencing-cost-evolution.png[]]

https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/inline-images/Sequencing_Cost_Per_Genome_Feb%202019.png[Image source].

Then, in the 2010's, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing[CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing] started opening up the way to actually modifying the genome that we could now see.

What's next?

I'd put my money on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_synthesis[DNA synthesis], see for example: https://twistbioscience.com/ | https://www.evonetix.com/technology/ | http://dnascript.co/ | https://www.ansabio.com/ | https://www.nuclera.com/

I'm also curious about simulations of cell metabolism, protein and small molecule, microscopy, analytical chemistry (mass spectroscopy), single cell techniques, ...

It's weird, cells feel a lot like <<linux-kernel-module-cheat,embedded systems>>: small, complex, hard to observe, and profound.

It saddens me that I'll die and humanity won't have understood the brain, maybe not even a measly E. Coli...

=== Ideology

==== Ultimate life goal

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income[Unconditional basic income] is my ultimate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism[non-transhumanist] dream: to reach a state of technological advancement and distribution of resources so high that everyone gets money for doing nothing, enough for:

* basic survival needs: food, housing, clothes, hygiene, etc.
* two children to keep the world going. Or immortality tech, but I think that is harder and borderline transhumanist :-)
* high speed computer and Internet

Once a person has that, they can <<write-free-books-to-get-famous-website,learn, teach>> and create whatever they want. Or play video games all day long if they wish.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots[I don't think I will live to see this], so I content myself with helping it happen faster by increasing the efficiency of the world as I can. And having at least two well educated kids to carry on the project after I die :-)

Technologies which would help a lot towards unconditional basic income and might be required but which I don't think I will live to see:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence[Artificial general intelligence] (AGI).
+
Given enough computational power per dollar, I believe AGI is inevitable.
+
Either:
+
--
** silicon based. Would be faster to achieve, but I'm not sure will ever happen given the end of Moore's Law
** genetically modified biological brains + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat[brain in a vat].
+
Imagine a brain the size of a building, perfectly engineered to solve certain engineering problems, and giving hints to human operators + taking feedback from cameras and audio attached to the operators.
+
This likely implies transhumanism, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading[mind uploading].
--
+
It was partly due this desire that I ended up learning systems programming and joining the silicon industry to help increase our computational capacity. The end of Moore's law might cut my dream short however, maybe we will never achieve silicon AGI.
* affordable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot[humanoid robots] with human-like energy efficiency and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio[power-to-weight ratio].
+
But I feel that this is even less likely than AGI, since I'm alive at the end of silicon Moore's law and at the start of the Genome's Moore's law: information doubles, small sizes halve, but macroscopic mechanical artifacts stay the same.
+
I'm pretty certain about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface[brain–computer interfaces], in particular https://github.com/cirosantilli/essays/blob/7e1147daeb941a95b96b099d0db0474db25116ea/questions-for-my-future-self.md[full BCI as defined here]. Post my life time however.
+
So in the worst case we can just grow brainless bodies and replace the cavity hole with a computer that controls the body, possibly with high level decisions coming from a remote building-sized genetically engineered biological AGI brain.

Of course, it is all about costs. A human costs about http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html[130k 2010 USD / year]. So how cheap can we make the AGI / robot human equivalent / year for a given task?

AGI + humanoid robots likely implies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover[AI takeover] though. It would then come down to human loving bots vs human hating bots fighting it out. It will be both terrifying and fun to watch.

AGI alone would be very dangerous, in case it can get control of our nuclear arsenals through software zero days or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29[social engineering]. Although some https://www.quora.com/Could-a-group-of-hackers-break-into-military-networks-and-launch-or-detonate-nuclear-missiles[claim that is unlikely].

==== Having more than one natural language is bad for the world

Natural language diversity is beautiful, but useless.

The fact that in poor countries a huge number of people do not speak the economically dominating language of the world (currently English), is a major obstacle to the development of those countries.

Despite us being in the information age, the people in those countries cannot fully benefit from it at all!

Teaching its people English should be the number one priority of any country. Without that, there can be no technological development. Everything else is secondary and can be learnt off the Internet once you know English.

And the most efficient way to do that, is that every country should create amazing free open source English learning material for their own language.

Also consider the European countries.

What big companies have been created in Europe in the past 50 years, that have not been bought out by American or Japanese companies?

The key problem is that there are so many small countries in Europe, that any startup has to deal with too many incompatible legislation and cannot easily sell to the hole of Europe.

So then a larger company from a more uniform country comes and eats it up!

So why can't Europe unify its laws?

Because the countries are still essentially walled off by languages.

There isn't true mobility of people between countries.

You just can't go study or work in any other country (except for the UK, when it was still in the EU) without putting a huge effort into learning its language first.

Without this, there isn't enough mixing to truly make cultures more uniform, and therefore allow the laws to be more uniform.

For this reason, I believe Europe will only continue to go downhill with the years.

It is the European https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel[Tower of Babel].

=== Developing this website

This website is powered by link:https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages].

The source code is located at: {cirosantilli-repo-url}

Build locally, watch for changes and rebuild automatically, and start a local server with:

....
bundle install
./run
....

and then visit the website at:

....
xdg-open http://localhost:8000
....

After making any changes to the README.adoc, simply refresh the page to view the updates.

If you make changes to other files however, do the full rebuild with:

....
./build
....

Source: link:build[]

Publish changes:

....
./publish
....

Source: link:publish[]

GitHub forces us to use the master branch for the build output... so the actual source is in the branch `dev`.

Update the gems with:

....
bundle update
git add Gemfile.lock
git commit -m 'update gems'
....

This website was originally written in Markdown and link:https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll[Jekyll], however those were deprecated in favour of Asciidoctor when I saw the light, rationale shown at: link:/markdown-style-guide#use-asciidoc[]

Jekyll is only used now for backwards compatibility to not break some key content with high PageRank, I might kill it entirely at some point.

GitHub pages is chosen instead of a GitHub README for the following reasons:

* I will want some unsupported extensions, notably mathematics, likely with Katex server side:

== Programming language choice

How I feel about various programming languages.

First, I feel that there is only space for two languages at most in the world: the compiled one, and the interpreted one.

For now, when I have the choice, I'll go for:

* Python as the interpreted one
* C++ for compiled

I also do some Bash when I'm lazy. But if the project goes on, I sooner or later regret that choice :-)

Those two are not by any means perfect from a language design point of view, and there are likely already better alternatives. I only choose them due to a pragmatic tradeoff between ecosystem and familiarity.

How I view other languages:

* C cool, but cannot make a large codebase DRY without insanity
* Ruby: the exact same as Python, and only strong in one domain: web, while Python rules everything else, and is not bad on web either. So just kill Ruby, please.
* JavaScript: I'm totally fine if NodeJS destroys Python and becomes the ONE scripting language to rule them all since Python and JavaScript are almost equally crappy.
+
I just don't use it much because of ecosystem / unfamiliarity.
* Java: good language, but I don't like the enterprisey ecosystem, and how closed Oracle has made the development process, and API patenting madness on Android.
* Haskell: I tried to learn some functional stuff, but too hard. Sounds really cool though.
* Rust: sounds cool, I would gladly replace C and C++ with it if the ecosystem ramps up.
* Go: likely a good replacement for Python. If the ecosystem gets there, I'll gladly use it more.
* Swift: I'm not an Apple person.
* Tcl, Perl: I'm not old enough for that, Python killed them before I awoke to programming. And I'm glad, Python feels less insane from my little exposure.
* R, GNU Octave: all of this is a waste of society's time, applied mathematicians are capable of writing a few braces in exchange for a sane general purpose language, we should just invest in good libraries with fast C bindings for those languages like Numpy where needed. And when I see the closed source ones like MATLAB being used, it makes me lose all hope on humanity.

It is interesting to see how your own ideas shift with time, I don't think the following are very important anymore, so I was lazy to migrate them:

* link:education[]
* link:skills[]

Likely because when I did the original website I was in a "I must show off my skills to get a job mindset", and now I'm more in a "CV websites are useless, just do amazing projects and showcase them on your website to help them succeed" mindset.

=== Why I removed Disqus comments from the website in 2019-05-04

Commit: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/commit/794705a201a79b5128934e69df85e3511655c03f

As I started getting a lot of comments on my home page, mostly about China, I decided that Disqus does not scale, and that it would be more productive long term to remove it and point people to GitHub issues instead.

Upsides of removal:

* Disqus discoverability is bad:
** there is no decent way to search existing issues, you have to do JavaScript infinite loading + Ctrl + F. So every reply that I write is a waste of time, as it will never be seen again.
** comments don't have: decent URLs, titles, metadata like tags or open / close
* Disqus archival is bad: http://web.archive.org/ does not work, and no one knows how to export the issues: https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Disqus
* before, I had two places where people could comment, Disqus and GitHub issues. Now there is just one.
* Disqus has ads if you ever reach enough traffic, which I'm not willing to have on my website, especially if I don't get paid for them! It also makes page loads slower, although that likely does not matter much.

Downsides:

* people are more likely to comment on Disqus than to create an issue on GitHub, especially because most people use GitHub professionally. But this has the upside that there will be less shitposts as well.
* with Disqus you can see all issues attached to a page automatically, which is nice. But for as long as I'm around, I intend to just solve the issues, cross link between content and issues and tag things appropriately.

My stance towards China hasn't changed, and China comments and corrections about this website are still welcome as always.

=== DNS configuration of this website

AKA how I serve this {cirosantilli-repo-url}[GitHub page] in my own domain.

I only touch this very rarely, and always forget and go into great pain whenever a change needs to done, so I really need to document what I did.

The last change was of 2019-07-07, when I moved from the www subdomain https://www.cirosantilli.com to the APEX https://cirosantilli.com[]. A redirect is setup from the www to APEX.

GoDaddy DNS entries:

....
Type    Name    Value                   TTL
A       @       185.199.108.153         1 Hour

=== Stack Overflow suspension for vote fraud script 2019-03-20

After I got a lot of attention on Hacker News https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19428700 my Stack Overflow account was suspended for 3 days http://web.archive.org/web/20190320163458/https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245/ciro-santilli-新疆改造中心-六四事件-法轮功 and I received a magic notification that led to a private message:

Hello,

I'm writing in reference to your Stack Overflow account:

I don't understand why you are actively promoting and assisting people to commit fraud on the site.

I've removed this from your profile https://github.com/cirosantilli/stack-overflow-vote-fraud-script and do not expect you to post it around the site.

I'm suspending you to gain your attention on this matter.

We have temporarily suspended your account; you may return after 3 days.

Regards,

Stack Overflow Moderation Team

Hi mods,

. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle
+
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/533965/why-is-security-through-obscurity-a-bad-idea
+
Security by obscurity does not work. If that is all Stack Overflow relies on, and that is what it looks like, then it is guaranteed to be flawed and already been attacked.
+
That is one of the reasons that my website will eventually beat Stack Overflow: https://github.com/cirosantilli/write-free-science-books-to-get-famous-website/tree/d77b18d2e7acb3558615797c36195f60dfd26306#pagerank-with-tags
. If you had messaged me and told me "take down or suspend" I would have done it immediately because I understand the meaning of political power.
+
That would have been the better course of action for everyone: I get no block, and you get no bad publicity as I shout Kerckhoff's principle on Twitter.
+
But maybe it is a good thing that people learn more about that.
. Is there an existing public discussion saying that you cannot advertise vote fraud tools on this website?
+
If not, can you please create that meta thread as a reference for future users, and perhaps let the community decide by itself?
+
In particular, will you still suspend me if I don't take down the GitHub repo?
+
Because if not, does it make any sense to prevent it from being mentioned in Stack Overflow? Any good GitHub repo just gets enough Google pagerank that it won't matter.
+
And if yes, nothing prevents me from re-uploading on an anonymous account.

Reply and unsuspend quickly followed, with link still removed:

I suspended you to get your attention. Your attitude about going to Twitter about it does not bode well with me.

Feel free to have whatever you want in your GitHub repo. Just don't advertise tools to make it easier for people to circumvent the rules. As easy or as hard as it may be to circumvent them, you're handing it to people who may not be capable of doing so. It doesn't help.

Don't make threats to upload on an anonymous account. Accounts created to circumvent previous warnings are not welcomed on the site.

We don't need a meta thread to discuss whether it's ok to post voting fraud links in your profile and we definitely don't need to give it anymore publicity.

I'll unsuspend you, now we've had this discussion.

Regards,

Stack Overflow Moderation Team

A meta thread was later created by Yvette, to which I answered with the correct unpopular answer that will be downvoted to oblivion: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/381577/is-it-ok-to-have-links-on-how-to-create-sock-puppets-and-gain-rep-fraudulently-i/381635#381635

== Physics

=== Particle physics

AKA: standard model.

==== How does Dirac's equation model spin?

This tutorial is awesome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCuaBmAzqek "Quantum Mechanics 12a - Dirac Equation I" by "viascience" published 2015-12-19.

==== What does it mean that photons are force carriers for electromagnetism?

TODO.

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61095/photon-as-the-carrier-of-the-electromagnetic-force

==== Why do symmetries such as SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) matter in particle physics?

TODO.

==== Particle physics applications

==== Quantum Chromodynamics

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoR3hq5b5yE "Quarks, Gluon flux tubes, Strong Nuclear Force, & Quantum Chromodynamics" by "Physics Videos by Eugene Khutoryansky". Some decent visualizations.

==== Particle physics bibliography

YouTube channels:

* PBS Space Time: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g A bit on the superficial side, but OK, 5-10 minute videos.
* Physics Videos by Eugene Khutoryansky https://www.youtube.com/user/EugeneKhutoryansky Some insight, but too slow and not experiments, just "truth".

== Art

Stuff that is beautiful and useless.

=== Video games

The things I like the most about video games as an adult are to watch:

* TAS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun
* speed running evolution videos, which I consider as a probabilistic human achievable TAS

The most beautiful TAS I have ever seen are (highly biased by games I played casually when young):

* Super mario 64
