To contact me publicly about any general subject that is not covered in a more specif repository, including saying hi or suggestions about this website, create a GitHub issue at: {cirosantilli-repo-url}/issues/new

For comments about China, please first read:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship#faq
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

and then create a GitHub issue at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/new

If you need private contact, extract my email from on of my GitHub repos or use LinkedIn.

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus[Disqus comments] were removed from this website in 2019-05-04, a manual dump is link:/disqus-archive/[available here], removal rationale: <<why-i-removed-disqus-comments-from-the-website-in-2019-05-04>>.

=== How to develop this website

This website is powered by link:https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages].

The source code is located at: {cirosantilli-repo-url}

Build locally, watch for changes and rebuild automatically, and start a local server with:

....
bundle install
./run
....

and then visit the website at:

....
xdg-open http://localhost:8000
....

After making any changes to the README.adoc, simply refresh the page to view the updates.

If you make changes to other files however, do the full rebuild with:

....
./build
....

Source: link:build[]

Publish changes: TODO

Update the gems with:

....
bundle update
git add Gemfile.lock
git commit -m 'update gems'
....

This website was originally written in Markdown and link:https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll[Jekyll], however those were deprecated in favour of Asciidoctor when I saw the light, rationale shown at: link:/markdown-style-guide#use-asciidoc[]

Jekyll is only used now for backwards compatibility to not break some key content with high PageRank, I might kill it entirely at some point.

GitHub pages is chosen instead of a GitHub README for the following reasons:

* I will want some unsupported extensions, notably mathematics, likely with Katex server side:
** https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/pull/3338
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog

** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog
** https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-combine-latex-and-markdown-in-GitHub
* when GitHub dies, my website URL still lives and retains the PageRank!

== Programming language choice

How I feel about various programming languages.

First, I feel that there is only space for two languages at most in the world: the compiled one, and the interpreted one.

For now, when I have the choice, I'll go for:

* Python as the interpreted one
* C++ for compiled

I also do some Bash when I'm lazy. But if the project goes on, I sooner or later regret that choice :-)

Those two are not by any means perfect from a language design point of view, and there are likely already better alternatives. I only choose them due to a pragmatic tradeoff between ecosystem and familiarity.

How I view other languages:

* C cool, but cannot make a large codebase DRY without insanity
* Ruby: the exact same as Python, and only strong in one domain: web, while Python rules everything else, and is not bad on web either. So just kill Ruby, please.
* JavaScript: I'm totally fine if NodeJS destroys Python and becomes the ONE scripting language to rule them all since Python and JavaScript are almost equally crappy.
+
I just don't use it much because of ecosystem / unfamiliarity.
* Java: good language, but I don't like the enterprisey ecosystem, and how closed Oracle has made the development process, and API patenting madness on Android.
* Haskell: I tried to learn some functional stuff, but too hard. Sounds really cool though.
* Rust: sounds cool, I would gladly replace C and C++ with it if the ecosystem ramps up.
* Go: likely a good replacement for Python. If the ecosystem gets there, I'll gladly use it more.
* Swift: I'm not an Apple person.
* Tcl, Perl: I'm not old enough for that, Python killed them before I awoke to programming. And I'm glad, Python feels less insane from my little exposure.

== About this website

=== Unmigrated sections of the old website

It is interesting to see how your own ideas shift with time, I don't think the following are very important anymore, so I was lazy to migrate them:

* link:education[]
* link:skills[]

Likely because when I did the original website I was in a "I must show off my skills to get a job mindset", and now I'm more in a "CV websites are useless, just do amazing projects and showcase them on your website to help them succeed" mindset.

=== Why I removed Disqus comments from the website in 2019-05-04

Commit: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/commit/794705a201a79b5128934e69df85e3511655c03f

As I started getting a lot of comments on my home page, mostly about China, I decided that Disqus does not scale, and that it would be more productive long term to remove it and point people to GitHub issues instead.

Upsides of removal:

* Disqus discoverability is bad:
** there is no decent way to search existing issues, you have to do JavaScript infinite loading + Ctrl + F. So every reply that I write is a waste of time, as it will never be seen again. 
** comments don't have: decent URLs, titles, metadata like tags or open / close
* Disqus archival is bad: http://web.archive.org/ does not work, and no one knows how to export the issues: https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Disqus
* before, I had two places where people could comment, Disqus and GitHub issues. Now there is just one.
* Disqus has ads if you ever reach enough traffic, which I'm not willing to have on my website, especially if I don't get paid for them! It also makes page loads slower, although that likely does not matter much.

Downsides:

* people are more likely to comment on Disqus than to create an issue on GitHub, especially because most people use GitHub professionally. But this has the upside that there will be less shitposts as well.
* with Disqus you can see all issues attached to a page automatically, which is nice. But for as long as I'm around, I intend to just solve the issues, cross link between content and issues and tag things appropriately.

My stance towards China hasn't changed, and China comments and corrections about this website are still welcome as always.

=== Stack Overflow suspension for vote fraud script 2019-03-20

After I got a lot of attention on Hacker News https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19428700 my Stack Overflow account was suspended for 3 days http://web.archive.org/web/20190320163458/https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245/ciro-santilli-新疆改造中心-六四事件-法轮功 and I received a magic notification that led to a private message:

Hello,

I'm writing in reference to your Stack Overflow account:

I don't understand why you are actively promoting and assisting people to commit fraud on the site.

I've removed this from your profile https://github.com/cirosantilli/stack-overflow-vote-fraud-script and do not expect you to post it around the site.

I'm suspending you to gain your attention on this matter.

We have temporarily suspended your account; you may return after 3 days.

Regards,

Stack Overflow Moderation Team

Hi mods,

. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/533965/why-is-security-through-obscurity-a-bad-idea
+
Security by obscurity does not work. If that is all Stack Overflow relies on, and that is what it looks like, then it is guaranteed to be flawed and already been attacked. 
+
That is one of the reasons that my website will eventually beat Stack Overflow: https://github.com/cirosantilli/write-free-science-books-to-get-famous-website/tree/d77b18d2e7acb3558615797c36195f60dfd26306#pagerank-with-tags
. If you had messaged me and told me "take down or suspend" I would have done it immediately because I understand the meaning of political power.
+
That would have been the better course of action for everyone: I get no block, and you get no bad publicity as I shout Kerckhoff's principle on Twitter.
+
But maybe it is a good thing that people learn more about that.
. Is there an existing public discussion saying that you cannot advertise vote fraud tools on this website?
+
If not, can you please create that meta thread as a reference for future users, and perhaps let the community decide by itself?
+
In particular, will you still suspend me if I don't take down the GitHub repo?
+
Because if not, does it make any sense to prevent it from being mentioned in Stack Overflow? Any good GitHub repo just gets enough Google pagerank that it won't matter.
+
And if yes, nothing prevents me from re-uploading on an anonymous account.

Reply and unsuspend quickly followed, with link still removed:

I suspended you to get your attention. Your attitude about going to Twitter about it does not bode well with me.

Feel free to have whatever you want in your GitHub repo. Just don't advertise tools to make it easier for people to circumvent the rules. As easy or as hard as it may be to circumvent them, you're handing it to people who may not be capable of doing so. It doesn't help.

Don't make threats to upload on an anonymous account. Accounts created to circumvent previous warnings are not welcomed on the site.

We don't need a meta thread to discuss whether it's ok to post voting fraud links in your profile and we definitely don't need to give it anymore publicity.

I'll unsuspend you, now we've had this discussion.

Regards,

Stack Overflow Moderation Team

A meta thread was later created by Yvette, to which I answered with the correct unpopular answer that will be downvoted to oblivion: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/381577/is-it-ok-to-have-links-on-how-to-create-sock-puppets-and-gain-rep-fraudulently-i/381635#381635

== Physics

=== Particle physics

AKA: standard model.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoR3hq5b5yE "Quarks, Gluon flux tubes, Strong Nuclear Force, & Quantum Chromodynamics" by "Physics Videos by Eugene Khutoryansky". Some decent visualizations.

==== Particle physics bibliography

Youtube channels:

* PBS Space Time: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g A bit on the superficial side, but OK, 5-10 minute videos.
* Physics Videos by Eugene Khutoryansky https://www.youtube.com/user/EugeneKhutoryansky Some insight, but too slow and not experiments, just "truth".

== Art

Stuff that is beautiful and useless.

=== Video games

The things I like the most about video games as an adult are to watch:

* TAS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun
* speed running evolution videos, which I consider as a probabilistic human achievable TAS

The most beautiful TAS I have ever seen are (highly biased by games I played casually when young):

* Super mario 64
