* Vim or Emacs: Vim. But for The Love, will someone please make an open source C++ IDE that actually just works?
* Tabs or spaces: spaces
* Mailing list or Git(Hub|Lab): Git(Hub|Lab), link:https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23197/reply-to-mailman-archived-message/115088#115088[with passion]
* System or unit tests: system
* Default programming languages: Python and C++. https://github.com/cirosantilli/essays/tree/59adcc6dcd0b16430fe97495aa5b98707abc53d8#programming-language-choice[I'll learn Rust and Haskell once I'm rich]
* Favorite musical instruments to listen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin[Chinese Guqin] and electric Jazz-fusion guitar

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus[Disqus comments] were removed from this website in 2019-05-04, a manual dump is link:/disqus-archive/[available here], removal rationale: <<why-i-removed-disqus-comments-from-the-website-in-2019-05-04>>

=== How to develop this website

This website is powered by link:https://pages.github.com[GitHub Pages].

The source code is located at: {cirosantilli-repo-url}

Build locally, watch for changes and rebuild automatically, and start a local server with:

....
bundle install
./run
....

and then visit the website at:

....
xdg-open http://localhost:8000
....

After making any changes to the README.adoc, simply refresh the page to view the updates.

Source: link:run[]


Source: link:build-adoc[]

Some things in the website need a local sever to be running, notably in older semi-deprecated Jekyll parts, e.g. `index.html` resolution. Run it with:

....
./run
....

Publish changes: TODO

Update the gems with:

....
bundle update
git add Gemfile.lock
git commit -m 'update gems'
....

This website was originally written in Markdown and link:https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll[Jekyll], however those were deprecated in favour of Asciidoctor when I saw the light, rationale shown at: link:/markdown-style-guide#use-asciidoc[]

Jekyll is only used now for backwards compatibility to not break some key content with high PageRank, I might kill it entirely at some point.

GitHub pages is chosen instead of a GitHub README for the following reasons:

* I will want some unsupported extensions, notably mathematics, likely with Katex server side:
** https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/pull/3338
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog
** https://g14n.info/2014/09/math-on-github-pages/
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog
** https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-combine-latex-and-markdown-in-GitHub
* when GitHub dies, my website URL still lives and retains the PageRank!

== Why I removed Disqus comments from the website in 2019-05-04

Commit: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/commit/794705a201a79b5128934e69df85e3511655c03f

As I started getting a lot of comments on my home page, mostly about China, I decided that Disqus does not scale, and that it would be more productive long term to remove it and point people to GitHub issues instead.

Upsides of removal:

* Disqus discoverability is bad:
** there is no decent way to search existing issues, you have to do JavaScript infinite loading + Ctrl + F. So every reply that I write is a waste of time, as it will never be seen again. 
** comments don't have: decent URLs, titles, metadata like tags or open / close
* Disqus archival is bad: http://web.archive.org/ does not work, and no one knows how to export the issues: https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Disqus
* before, I had two places where people could comment, Disqus and GitHub issues. Now there is just one.
* Disqus has ads if you ever reach enough traffic, which I'm not willing to have on my website, especially if I don't get paid for them! It also makes page loads slower, although that likely does not matter much.

Downsides:

* people are more likely to comment on Disqus than to create an issue on GitHub, especially because most people use GitHub professionally. But this has the upside that there will be less shitposts as well.
* with Disqus you can see all issues attached to a page automatically, which is nice. But for as long as I'm around, I intend to just solve the issues, cross link between content and issues and tag things appropriately.

My stance towards China hasn't changed, and China comments and corrections about this website are still welcome as always.

== Video games

The things I like the most about video games as an adult are to watch:

* TAS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun
* speed running evolution videos, which I consider as a probabilistic human achievable TAS

The most beautiful TAS I have ever seen are (highly biased by games I played casually when young):

* Super mario 64
** no-A press 120 stars attempts by shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannenkoek2012
+
2018 video outlining the 18 unique A presses missing for 120-stars at the time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJaL5QOq590
+
One of the most elaborate explained videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A "SM64 - Watch for Rolling Rocks - 0.5x A Presses"
** 1-key any percent run:

==== Why do symmetries such as SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) matter in particle physics?

==== Quantum Chromodynamics

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoR3hq5b5yE "Quarks, Gluon flux tubes, Strong Nuclear Force, & Quantum Chromodynamics" by "Physics Videos by Eugene Khutoryansky". Some decent visualizations.

==== Particle physics bibliography

Youtube channels:

* PBS Space Time: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g A bit on the superficial side, but OK, 5-10 minute videos.
* Physics Videos by Eugene Khutoryansky https://www.youtube.com/user/EugeneKhutoryansky Some insight, but too slow and not experiments, just "truth".
