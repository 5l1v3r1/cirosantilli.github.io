## Stack Overflow

I like to answer important questions, for which none of the answers satisfied me, and close duplicates.

I don't like to refresh the homepage looking for easy rep :)

[Necromancer](http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/17/necromancer) is my favorite badge.

Those answers contain hard to find information, which I produced through a lot of synthesis and experimentation effort. They are not necessarily the most upvoted ones.
