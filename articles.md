## Stack Overflow style

[![Stack overflow flare](http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/895245.png?theme=dark)][stack-overflow-ciro]

I like to answer important questions, for which none of the answers satisfied me, and close duplicates.

I don't like to refresh the homepage looking for easy rep :-)

[Necromancer](http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/17/necromancer) is my favorite badge. If you consider that a meaningful metric, which implies that you are insane, then [I was one of the top 20 users](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/300737) as of April 2015.
