= How to use an Oxford Nanopore MinION to extract DNA from river water and determine which bacteria live in it

The aim of this article is to give a feeling of how this kind of biological experiment feels like to a person who has never done any link:/#biology[biology] like link:/#ciro-santilli[Ciro]. Parent node: link:/#articles[].

toc::[]

== Setting

https://www.puntseq.co.uk/[PuntSeq] is a side project led by a few https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge[Cambridge University] PhDs that aims to determine which bacteria are present in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Cam[River Cam].

In July 2019, the PuntSeq team got together with the awesome https://biomake.space[Cambridge Biomakespace], an awesome biology makerspace open to all, to create a two day science outreach activity showing their procedures.

Ciro knows nothing about biology, but since he is link:#molecular-biology-is-the-next-big-thing-so-do-anything-in-that-area[very curious about it], in particular he jumped at this opportunity, and decided to document things as well as his limited knowledge would allow.

All participants chipped in some money to help cover the experiment's costs. Ciro suspects that this activity was done partially to help crowdfund the experiment, but it was a worthy investment!

The impressions you get from the experiment as a software engineer will be:

* OMG, this is so labour intensive, why haven't they automated this
* OMG, this is frightening, all the 8 hours of work I've just done are present in that tiny plastic tube
* Amazing! Look at that apparatus! And the bio people are like: I've used this a million times, it's cheap and every lab has one, just work faster you piece of junk!

== Overview of the experiment

The PuntSeq team uses an xref:oxford-nanopore-minion[] sequencer made by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Nanopore_Technologies[Oxford Nanopore Technologies] to sequence the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA[16S] region of bacterial DNA, which is about 1500 nucleotides long.

The 16S region codes for one of the RNA pieces that makes the https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ribosome&oldid=912600990#Bacterial_ribosomes[bacterial ribosome]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote[Eukaryotes] don't have an analogous ribosome part.

Before sequencing the DNA, we will do a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction[PCR] with primers that fit just before and just after the 16S DNA, in well conserved regions expected to be present in all bacteria.

This way, we amplify only the 16S region of bacteria, excluding other parts of bacterial genome, and excluding prokaryotes entirely.

Despite coding such a fundamental piece of RNA, there is still surprisingly variability in the 16S region across different bacteria, and it is those differences will allow us to identify which bacteria are present in the river.

The variability exists because certain base pairs are not fundamental for the function of the 16S region. This variability happens mostly on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop[RNA loops as opposed to stems], i.e. parts of the RNA that don't base pair with other RNA in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_secondary_structure[RNA secondary structure] as shown at: xref:listing-rna-stem-loop[xrefstyle=full].

This is how the 16S RNA secondary structure looks like in its full glory: xref:image-16s-rna-secondary-structure[xrefstyle=full].

Since loops don't base pair, they are less crucial in the determination of the secondary structure of the RNA.

The variability may however not be large enough to allow us to differentiate between related species which might have the same sequence, but we should at least be able to obtain at least a reasonable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum[phylum] breakdown.

=== Why Oxford Nanopore was used instead of Illumina for the sequencing

link:++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina,_Inc.++[Illumina equipment] is currently cheaper per base pair and dominates the human genome sequencing market, but it requires a much higher initial investment for the equipment

The Nanopore costs just about 500 pounds for the reusable machine, and 500 pounds for the one usage flow cell which can decode up to 30 billion base pairs, which is about 10 human genomes!

Other advantages of the MinION over Illumina which didn't really matter to this particular experiment are:

* portability for e.g. to do analysis on the field near infections outbreaks
* long reads which can be necessary for long repetitive regions

One disadvantage of the Oxford Nanopore is that its error rate per base pair read is higher than Illumina.

=== Metagenomics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics

This kind of "sequence some random DNA to determine what is present in the sample" analysis is called metagenomics.

Besides river sample, other types of samples where of metagenomics is used include:

* food, including searching for desirable microorganisms such as in cheese or bread yeast
* poo, e.g. to study how the human microbiome influences health https://www.microbiotica.com/
* blood, e.g. to search for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulating_tumor_DNA[Circulating tumor DNA]

== Sample collection

As you would expect, not much secret here, we just dumped a 1L glass bottle with a rope attached around the neck in the river, and pulled it out with the rope.

The temperature of the water was measured with a mercury thermometer, and the PH with pH strips and a cell phone app to compare the color of the strip.

There were some swans in the river, so... swan poo bacteria I guess?

And, in the name of science, we even wore gloves to not contaminate the samples!

== DNA extraction

The first thing we had to do with the sample was to extract the DNA present in the water in a pure form for the PCR.

We did that with a xref:qiagen-dneasy-powerwater-kit[].

As you would expect, this consists of a purification procedure with several steps.

In each step we take a physical or chemical action on the sample, which splits it into two parts: the one with the DNA and the one without.

We then take the part with the DNA, and throw away the one without the DNA.

The first steps are coarser, and finer and finer splits are done as we move forward.

=== Filtration with vacuum pump

The first thing we did was to filter the water samples with a filter that is so fine that not even DNA can pass through, but water can.

This will reduce the 1 liter volumes to more manageable amounts. Reagents are expensive, and centrifuges are small!

Since the filter is so fine, filtering by gravity alone would take forever, and so we used a vacuum pump to speed thing up!

For that we used:

* xref:thermo-scientific-nalgene-polysulfone-reusable-bottle-top-filters[]
* xref:knf-laboport-series-laboratory-vacuum-pump[]

wikimedia_video::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Vacuum_pump_filter_cut_and_place_in_eppendorf.webm[height=400]

=== Post filtration purification

Now that we had the DNA in Eppendorfs, we were ready to continue the purification in a simpler and more standardized lab pipeline fashion.

First we added some small specialized stones and chemicals to the water and shook them Eppendorfs hard in a xref:scientific-industries-inc-vortex-genie-2[] machine to break the cells and free the DNA.

Once that was done, added several reagents which split the solution into two phases: one containing the DNA and the other not. We would then pipette the phase with the DNA out to the next Eppendorf, and continue the process.



== PCR

PCR protocols are very standard it seems, all that biologists need to know to reproduce is the time and temperature of each step.

We did 35 cycles of:

* 94˚C for 30 seconds
* 60˚C for 30 seconds
* 72˚C for 45 seconds

We added PCR primers for regions that surround the 16S DNA. The primers are just bought from a vendor, and we used well known regions are called 27F and 1492R. Here is a paper that analyzes other choices: https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/221/2/299/630719 (http://web.archive.org/web/20190911091818/https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/221/2/299/630719[archive]) "Evaluation of primers and PCR conditions for the analysis of 16S rRNA genes from a natural environment" by "Yuichi Hongoh, Hiroe Yuzawa, Moriya Ohkuma, Toshiaki Kudo Published" published 01 April 2003.

One cool thing about the PCR is that we can also add a known barcode at the end of each primer as shown at xref:listing-pcr-diagram[xrefstyle=full]. This way, we were able to:

* add a different barcode for samples collected from different locations
* sequence them all in one go
* then just from the sequencing output the barcode to determine where each sequence came from!

Finally, after purification, we used the xref:qiagen-qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit[] protocol to purify the generated from unwanted PCR byproducts.

== Sequencing

Once we had the amplified 16S DNA clean, we were almost ready to start sequencing!

Before that, we just had to prepare the clean DNA for the sequencing with the xref:oxford-nanopore-sqk-lsk109-ligation-sequencing-kit[].

== Bioinformatics

After the sequencing was done, we analyzed the data using computer programs that match the sequenced 16S sequences to a database of known sequenced species.

This is of course not just a simple direct string matching problem, since like any in experiment, the DNA reads have some errors, so the program has to find the best match even though it is not exact.
